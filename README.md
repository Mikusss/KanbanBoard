# KanbanBoard
The "Kanban Board " desktop app allows users to create their own Kanban Board that can be later on used to manage their projects, to-do lists, or even their daily life.

# The Main Idea
The app contains 3 different lists of elements:

<ul><li><b>To-do list:</b> The user can add tasks that are still not started.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ongoing list:</b> The user can add tasks that they started but still not finished.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Done list:</b> The user can add tasks that are already done.</li></ul>

The user can add "cards" to any list as they wish, and later on delete them. Also, the user can  delete those cards once they're not necessary anymore. This app allows the user to improve their project and time management.

# Functionalities
The app contains various functionalities, such as:

<ul><li><b>Add new card:</b> The user can add new cards (tasks) to any list</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Delete a card:</b> Each card added by the user can be later on deleted from any list</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Add a deadlin:</b> The user can add a deadline to any card</b></li></ul>

# Tools Used
To create this app, I am using tools like:

<ul><li><b>Miro.com:</b> Used for creating a graphical project</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Github:</b> Used for project management</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>JavaFX (Scene Builder):</b> Used for creating the layout of the app</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>IntelIJ:</b> Used for coding all of the functionalities within the app</li></ul>

# Future Improvements
As the time passes, the app will be improved on and new functionalities will be built. Some of them include:

<ul><li><b>Drag and drop:</b> The user will be able to drag and drop cards between different lists to make managing tasks easier and faster.</li></ul>
